Daily Routine app built on SwiftUI for IOS by David Fumagalli

It takes an average of 66 days to fully establish a daily routine. The key to maintaining that streak is keeping yourself organized and consistent,
and now this app helps you bring your goal into reality. Featuring a user-friendly and fun experience, staying on track has never felt so easy.

## Features

### Creating Different Routines

On open, the app allows the user to both create new routines and access already made ones. By creating a routine, the user
has the option to give the routine a name and a color to associate it with. On creation, the app stores a new routine and
displays it in the list of routines in its color along with the total time of its actions. The user can rearrange the order of the routines
and delete any as they wish.

### Adding Actions to Routines

Once a routine is created, the app allows the user to add actions to the routine. An action is created by giving a name and a time it should take to complete, and this information is stored in the routine. The user can then view the action in the list of actions contained by the routine.

### Editing Routines and Actions

Both the list of routines and list of actions within each routine can be rearranged. Editing routines brings a view of the list of actions and the name and color, all of which can be altered. Actions can be deleted or have their time edited by focusing the action element.

### Completing a Routine

When selecting a routine and beginning, the app comes to life. The interactive animation state displays the action needed to be done and the time remaining. Holding down on the screen expands the inner circle and creates a bubbly effect, and when the app registers the user's holding gesture, the next action comes on screen and the process repeats. When the timer is up, the screen changes to red to alert the user of taking longer than planned on their aciton. When the routine is completed, the app tells the user that the routine is done.
